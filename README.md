# Neural Networks and Deep Learning in Scala

Repository contains various exercises and programs from the ["Neural Networks and Deep Learning" online book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).

## Running the code

Executable exercises code is located in `ru.pavkin.ml.exercises` package.

Before running `ImageRecognition` exercise you will need to unzip [MNIST training data-sets](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) into your resources folder:

1. Download [images archive](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz) and unzip into `.src/main/resources/train-images-idx3-ubyte`
2. Download [labels archive](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz) and unzip into `.src/main/resources/train-labels-idx1-ubyte`
